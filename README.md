## Why Economica?
With Economica, our goal is to create the most customizable economy bot with the capability of producing complex server economies while also retaining an easy-to-use, easy-to-play interface.

## How does Economica compare to other bots?
We at Economica were inspired by—and huge fans of—UnbelievaBoat and Dank Memer. Our original goal was to create a bot that had the best aspects of both of them: the customizability of UBB and the detail in Dank Memer. Our ambition is to create a bot that surpasses both.
